"""AgeKeeper project package.

This repository groups modules for Age of Empires II data retrieval, lobby and
player-state tracking, replay scraping, and watchlist-driven alerting. Subpackages
are organized by responsibility (`aoe2api`, `lobby`, `scraper`, `shared`, and
`spies`) to keep runtime behavior and integrations modular.
